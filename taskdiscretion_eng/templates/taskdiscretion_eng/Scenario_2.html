   <p>
        In December 2017, Agrifirm acquired another animal feed producer, named Breecorp. Since the purchase price
        exceeded the value of the net identifiable assets of Breecorp, Agrifirm recorded goodwill in their books at
        fair value. <br/>
        <br/>
        Part of these acquisition were two patents. These patents are related to the design and the development of
        two agricultural machines â€“ <i>Feeder 2000</i> en <i>Robofer</i> - that improve the transformation of wheat in
        animal feed significantly. The patents give Agrifirm the right to exclude other parties from commercial exploitation
        of the development for a period of eight years (2018-2025). Both machines are not used and exploited by Agrifirm,
        but instead Agrifirm signed an agreement that transfers the exclusive rights to use and produce the machines
        to CMG Machines. In return, Agrifirm receives royalty payments that are based on a percentage of the
        machine-specific revenues made by CMG Machines. The patents are recorded against fair value. <br/>
        <br/>
        The audit of these patents will be conducted by you. {% if player.treat in Constants.odd %}In this audit
