## Authors: [Bart Dierynck](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/b.dierynck.htm) and [Christian Peters](http://christianpeters.site)

This repository contains the oTree instance for the study "Auditor Task Prioritization: The Effects of Time Pressure and Psychological Ownership." The Dutch version 'taskdiscretion_nl' is administered among a sample of staff auditors. The English version 'taskdiscretion_eng' is a translation of the administered version.

A demo version of the instrument can be accessed [here](http://auditstudy.herokuapp.com/).
